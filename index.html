                <p>Don’t you just love exploring beautiful and neat sites with a clean user interface? While most of us
                    would reply with an assertive ‘YES,’ little, do we know the kind of effort and skill that goes into
                    making a website attractive and user-friendly. The secret to creating an impressive site is to
                    master the art of front-end development, and no, it is not as easy as it seems!
                <p>
                <p>However, it is not impossible either. Here are five tips that’ll help you get better in front-end
                    design and web development.</p>

                <!-- List of points -->
                <ol>

                    <li>
                        <b> Commenting </b> <br>
                        <p>Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers, especially for codes
                            that are written by multiple programmers. But remember, commenting is an important part of
                            project you create. With proper comments and organised files its always easier for you or
                            others to jump in and understand where things are at and how they work.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b> Invest In Productive Tools. </b> <br>
                        <p>The Internet is teeming with a host of web development tools, from browser add-ons to smart
                            plugins, the amount of choices available now is massive! So, why not invest in some really
                            productive web tools that’ll help you improve your front-end designing skills? Tools like
                            Sublime Text, jQuery, Emmet, GitHub, Bootstrap, and Sass are nothing short of a godsend for
                            web developers.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b> Always Be Curious. </b> <br>
                        <p>A front-end developer has to keep himself/herself updated continuously with the latest news
                            and innovations in the field. You need to take a proactive stand and learn new things about
                            front-end development from informative blogs and videos. Following are some of the most
                            informative and useful learning sources for front-end developers -</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Also, make it a point to attend conferences and webinars. These meet-ups provide excellent
                            opportunities to expand your network and get acquainted with talented people.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Refactor Your Code From Time To Time.</b> <br>
                        <p>By “refactoring” your code, you’re only enhancing the code without tampering with its
                            functionality. This will improve the quality and readability quotient of your code and the
                            more often you do it, your code will continually be updated into a cleaner and fresher
                            version of what it was before. Apart from that, one of the most significant advantages that
                            refactoring offers is that it ensures your code remains free from plagiarism.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b> Automate! </b> <br>
                        <p>As a front-end developer, you already have to take care of minute little details that can get
                            overwhelming at times. You have to invest your time on things like Boilerplate, testing,
                            workflow, dependency management, performance, optimization, build, deployment, and so on.
                            Doesn’t sound easy, right?</p>
                        <p>Take some steam off yourself and incorporate automation into your workflow. While automation
                            can take care of things such as optimization, testing, etc., you can focus on the core areas
                            of front-end development such as HTML, CSS, creating the client-side software, enhancing the
                            user-experience, and so on. By doing so, not only will your productivity increase, but you
                            will also learn to use your time to focus on the areas that’ll improve the overall
                            functionality of your site. Grunt, Gulp, and Broccoli are some very efficient automation
                            tools.</p>
                    </li>

                </ol>
                <p>While these tips will surely help you become a better front-end designer, in the long run, you must
                    always remember two things while designing your platform – keep it simple and neat, and don’t forget
                    to create your signature style. And for all you peeps interested in making it big in front-end
                    development.</p>
